# 🚀 Spy Agency Blind Signature Project

Welcome to the **Spy Agency Blind Signature Project!** This project demonstrates the implementation of **blind signatures** using cryptographic techniques. It simulates how a spy agency can sign documents without knowing their content, ensuring anonymity and security. 🔒

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Implements **Blind Signatures** using RSA cryptography.  
✅ Ensures **message privacy** while allowing signature verification.  
✅ Uses **randomized document selection** for signature approval.  
✅ Secure **modular arithmetic** for cryptographic operations.  
✅ Fully implemented in **JavaScript (Node.js)** with strong cryptographic libraries.
